# WeCam

This is a simple web application that interactively displays camera data by utilizing Flickr APIs, React.js Web front-end library, and Google Material Design Lite. It allows the user to search or select a particular camera brand. When he/she clicks on a specific model of that brand, it shows some important camera specs, including an image of the camera, LCD Screen Size, Megapixels, and Memory Type.
